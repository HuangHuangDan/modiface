### modiface

# Introduction
This project is mianly about face recongnation and modifying, demonstrates a simple face recognition application using MTCNN for face detection and a pre-trained deep learning model for face recognition. The application can detect faces in images and.....###############################.....

# Features
Detect faces in images using MTCNN
Recognize and identify known faces using a pre-trained model 

# Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
Python 3.6 or higher
OpenCV
TensorFlow or PyTorch
facenet-pytorch (if using PyTorch for face recognition)
MTCNN
